# Philly Soupkitchen Finder

This is a prototype of my Code for Philly food justice project, that's also the Rails Portfolio Project for my Flatiron School FulLStack Developer Program. The idea has a winding history, but this iteration comes from a conversation with an official at the Dept of Public Health that went something like, "What I really need is a Yelp for soup kitchens and food pantries." THis is the poorest large city in the nation, and nearly 30% of the population relies on institutions like soupkitchens and foodpantries, something I hadn't realized before I began. 

In the web app's current form, you can check out reviews of soup kitchens and add your own. While some of the soupkitchens' names are taken from actual Philly soupkitchens, I used Sesame Street characters to be my test users. In a next iteration, I'll enter the entire data set of Philly soup kitchens, using the CSF format they're currently in, and then move on to include the food pantries.
